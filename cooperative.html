            <h2>The&nbsp;Cooperative</h2>
            <p>The Cooperative project reuses the Sha'an Harod cooperative complex, transforming an industrial skeleton into a flexible civic centre. The existing warehouses and grain silos become a foundation for local initiatives, including community workshops, a market hall and rehearsal rooms. By preserving the robust concrete frame, the project celebrates the site's heritage while inviting new programmes.</p>
            <p>To enable adaptability, prefabricated concrete elements assemble on‑site to form new columns and beams. This modular system allows lightweight enclosures and mezzanines to be inserted, creating a variety of spatial configurations. Each insert can be reconfigured or removed over time, aligning with the evolving needs of the community.</p>
            <p>The design is guided by a belief that architecture can empower people by providing spaces that evolve with them. The Cooperative becomes a social infrastructure that fosters interaction between local entrepreneurs, artists and residents while strengthening the connection between the kibbutz and surrounding villages.</p>
