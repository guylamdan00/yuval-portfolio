            <h2>The&nbsp;Boidem</h2>
            <p>The Boidem is a rooftop extension that explores how an attic can become a generous living space. Set above an existing apartment building, the new structure is conceived as a lightweight timber lattice that floats above the concrete roof. This lattice defines the enclosure while allowing light and air to permeate the interior.</p>
            <p>Inside, a series of sunken floors and built‑in furniture maximise headroom under the sloping roof. Large operable panels open the façade to reveal panoramic views of the city and dissolve boundaries between inside and outside. Materials are kept simple and warm, creating a tranquil retreat above the bustle of the street.</p>
            <p>The project demonstrates how modest interventions can unlock unused potential in existing buildings. By treating the rooftop as a site for new construction, the Boidem offers a model for densification that is sensitive to context and respectful of the original structure.</p>
