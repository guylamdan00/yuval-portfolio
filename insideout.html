            <h2>Inside&nbsp;Out</h2>
            <p>Inside Out is a house that turns conventional layout on its head. Rather than a closed box with a garden outside, the design carves the mass to create a series of courtyards, terraces and voids that bring the landscape into the heart of the home. Each room opens onto a different outdoor space, blurring the boundary between interior and exterior.</p>
            <p>The house is organised around a central atrium, which serves as the social core. Vertical circulation and structural elements are arranged to maximise openness and cross‑ventilation. The façades employ sliding panels and perforated screens that modulate sunlight and privacy, adapting to the changing seasons.</p>
            <p>Through its manipulation of solid and void, Inside Out challenges the notion of enclosure. It creates an architecture that adapts to climate and context and encourages residents to live in constant dialogue with their surroundings.</p>
