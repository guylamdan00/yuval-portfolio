            <h2>Arava&nbsp;Center</h2>
            <p>Located in the Arava desert, this centre serves as a hub for cultural events, research and community gathering. The harsh climate and vast landscape inspired a design that embraces the desert's beauty while providing shaded, comfortable spaces for people to meet and learn.</p>
            <p>Buildings are arranged around a central courtyard, which acts as an oasis. Thick rammed‑earth walls provide thermal mass, while overhanging roofs and pergolas offer shade. The material palette is rooted in the local earth, blending seamlessly with the environment and minimising the project's ecological footprint.</p>
            <p>The project aims to become a catalyst for sustainable development in the region, demonstrating how traditional building techniques can meet contemporary needs. It fosters a sense of ownership among local communities and visitors alike and encourages dialogue about the future of the desert.</p>
