            <h2>Land&nbsp;of&nbsp;Lords</h2>
            <p>The “Jesus Trail” meanders through pastoral landscapes between Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee. Over centuries this path has been shared by pilgrims, farmers and travellers, leaving layers of physical and intangible traces. Today, however, the land along the trail is fragmented by private farms and tourist developments, and the connection between the route and nearby communities is weak.</p>
            <p>The Land of Lords project proposes a series of stations along the trail that condense and expand space. Each station integrates shading structures, seating and local stone to provide places for rest and contemplation. Slender steel frames allow views to remain open, while the arrangement of walls and roofs frames the landscape and directs the eye.</p>
            <p>By anchoring the trail in a network of public spaces, the project hopes to unify the trail's narrative and strengthen ties between villages and travellers. It invites visitors to pause, engage with local culture and appreciate the subtle beauty of the Galilee.</p>
